I'm a sophomore student at Middle East Technical University

I used to do backend development with Java and Spring. However, I discovered that my real passion lies deep in machine learning. And since then, I have been doing my absolute best to learn as much as I can about ML, specifically deep learning.

My research interests are a bit broad since I'm already exploring. I'm interested in NLP/CV/RL. Some might say these are related topics, but I want to explore them individually and combine them at the end.

Also, last year I got accepted into New Jersey Institute of Technology for Fall 2025 with a full scholarship. However, I couldn't attend due to visa issues.


# Previous Experience

## METU BILTIR Center
I worked at [METU-BILTIR Center](https://biltir.metu.edu.tr/en) as research intern. I assisted upperclassmen and professors on their AI research.

**Lessons learned:** Surround yourself with smart people. Never get caught up with imposter syndrome.

## MalzemeListem
I worked at this small startup as a design engineer intern during the summer of my freshman year of high school. It was my first real job. After I left, CEO inherited a company from his father-in-law and shut down the startup.

**Lesson learned:** Build for the sake of building not for the money.
